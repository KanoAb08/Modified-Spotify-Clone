You can add any number of songs inside the already created folder named "Rap" or "Copyright Songs" inside of Songs Folder.
But if you want to add your own folder you can just simply add it inside songs folder but you have to add following things:
1) A cover photo with title named "cover.png"
2) A .json file named "info.json" which should include {"title":"your title", "description" : "your description"}
Also name the songs that you add in following format for better readability in the app:
     Song name-Artist name
